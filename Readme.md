## Project Overview

Working with biological images can pose significant challenges requiring research technical professionals (RTPs) with appropriate technical expertise. 
This project aims to address these by working to build image data stewardship skills, role recognition and career pathways within the UK community.

We will provide direct training support for RTPs integrating their data generation, curation and annotation work into the permanent scientific record. 
While doing so we aim to develop a comprehensive curriculum in image data management and stewardship, and deliver it via courses, workshops and train-the-trainer events.

This is where you will find all of the materials created and/or collected as part of the curriculum.
