# Notebooks

The Jupyter notebooks can be run in [Colab][https://colab.google/]. Navigate to a particular notebook and click on the ``Colab`` badge. Google Colab provides a Virtual Environment with a set of Python dependencies already installed. New dependencies are installed using the ``%pip`` magic.
